const smartifyTest1 = `There are many more tables in the database to link Games to aspects of the magazine recreations including Ads, Artwork, Photos and Screenshots. Advertising required an additional step owing to the same ad appearing in multiple publications. The real-world advertising concept of "ad campaigns" became the central database concern, with links to related games tied to the campaign which is then tied to appearances in magazines.
"This" is a- "test" paragraph that's got...um, a few test cases like the '80s and an "end of paragraph quote."
To prepare for discussion on how to handle Games going forward two examples were prepared to show off additional details outside of the source publications. Looking at either the Frogger or Lock 'N' Chase pages shows this alpha release's additions: Gameplay snippets, Documents (such as game boxes and manuals), Links (web resources outside of the three "reference" sites) and Videos. These additions also introduce the concept of GameReleases, an extension of the GamePlatforms table. Where GamePlatforms in concerned--with the mere mention of a videogame being available for a particular platform--GameReleases cements the existence of a title on a particular platform through primary source material.`
const smartifyTest2 = `<p>A neophyte has as much chance with Defender as he would if he were to take over the controls of an F-16. A reasonably good video-game athlete--that is how game junkies are beginning to describe themselves--will last it out for a few thousand points, or a couple of minutes. A superb player, the kind not seen in every arcade, may hit 500,000 on his best day. That is why when Juraszek began to close in on 1 million points toward the end of the first hour of his enchanted run, people began to notice. Darrell Schultz, one of the arcade's owners, asked Steve if he thought he could set a record.</p>
<p>"I said, 'Yeah,'" Juraszek recalls, "and he said, 'Go for it!'" Juraszek is a gangly young man who began playing pinball when he was ten, before video games had hit the scene. "I could buy a car or something with the money I've put into games," he says. with no appearance of regret. He started playing Defender in June, and by August he was pretty good. On his record day he kept up his strength by snapping at pizza slices that people held in front of his face. He said later that he was so excited he never even thought about going to the bathroom. His mother Joanne Juraszek watched for a while, utterly unimpressed, and agreed reluctantly to let him play till he dropped. "I just wish," she said later, "that he was this good about doing his homework."</p>

<p>As the scornful cry "So what?" echoes from glen to glen, and as the unmoved Joanne Juraszek admits that she finds her son's new fame "very strange," skeptical citizens might do well to pay attention to a peculiar clinking sound audible across the land. The noise is made by the estimated 20 billion quarters that poured last year into the arcade monsters. This is a figure that may be the public relations roar of a healthy young industry beating its chest, but one that investment analysts who specialize in the entertainment industry agree is not far wrong. While they spent this $5 billion, video-game addicts also were spending 75,000 man-years playing the machines.</p>
<p>These figures do not include an estimated $1 billion that consumers paid for video-game consoles that hook up to home television sets, and for the expensive cassettes that make them work. For comparison, $5 billion is exactly twice the reported take in the last fiscal year of all of the casinos in Nevada. It is almost twice the $2.8 billion gross of the U.S. movie industry. And it is three times more than the combined television revenues and gate receipts last year of major league baseball, basketball and football.</p>

<p>From what vast aquifer of cash does this astonishing gush of money flow? From the lunch money of schoolchildren, say angry parents who are determined, so to speak, to give video games no quarter. The town fathers of Irvington, N.Y. (pop. 6,000), rose up in wrath last July and passed an ordinance designed "to protect the adolescents of the village against the evils associated with gambling" (though video games offer no cash payoff and indeed almost never click out a single free game); they limited each establishment to three machines. Ralph Provenzano, owner of a deli opposite the Irvington Middle School, resents the suggestion that he is corrupting the youth, but agreed to turn off his three machines (Defender, Pac Man and Centipede) before the start of classes each morning. With some justice, he says, "I baby-sat a bunch of kids here all summer. It may have cost them money, but they were here, they were safe, and they didn't get into trouble."</p>
<p>The fears that occasionally are voiced of drug-buzzed, beery teen-agers hanging around video parlors in menacing packs seem absurdly exaggerated, and the likelihood is that communities with troublemaking youngsters had them before the arcades opened. But the video games are enormously addictive, and they do eat a lot of quarters. Atari, one of the leading video-game manufacturers, advertises a cheerful, fast-moving and very popular arcade game called Centipede with the words "Chomp. Chomp. Chomp. Chomp. Chomp" above a drawing of a voracious-looking centipede gnawing a coin.</p>
<p>An adult observer in New London, N.H. (pop. 3,000), wanders into Egan's, a pizza parlor with twelve video games, which has become the town's teen hang-out since it opened a few months ago. The place is clean and friendly, with no smell of funny cigarettes (many arcades sternly forbid smoking of any kind) and nothing in sight more menacing than an anchovy pizza. But a conversation with a twelve-year-old boy who is holding his own against Scramble, a Stern Electronics game in which the player tries to fly a jet through what looks like Mammoth Cave, produces unsettling information. "I usually bring $20," says the boy, when asked how much money he spends. As the observer is digesting this, the boy adds, "But today I brought $40." Proprietor Bob Egan, an insurance broker in New Jersey before he moved to New Hampshire last year, says that he too was surprised, but yes, the boy did change $40.</p>

		<strong>Unfazed by uproar around him, Los Angeles player foils aliens</strong>

<p>In Orlando, Fla., the consensus of fifth-graders at Blankner Elementary School is that $3 is a "minimum satisfactory amount" to take to an arcade, but several children talked of spending $10 or $20. "I used to spend money on my bike," one boy said ruefully. Not all game players throw huge sums into the coin chutes, but they agree that it takes an investment of between $20 and $50 to become proficient at any game challenging enough to be fun. There is no question that the money drain is one reason why such communities as Babylon, Long Island, Oakland, Calif., Pembroke Pines, Fla., and Durham, N.H., have passed ordinances restricting play by teen-agers of various ages. The New Hampshire Civil Liberties Union asked that enforcement be postponed till the U.S. Supreme Court rules on an ordinance passed in Mesquite, Texas, forbidding play by people under 17. Lower courts have twice struck down the ordinance.</p>
<p>The fact is, however, that teen-agers hoping to bankrupt themselves blissfully with a session of Asteroids or Missile Command may be frustrated not by a prejudicial ordinance but by a lunchtime crowd of adults monopolizing the machines. The Station Break Family Amusement Center in Washington's L'Enfant Plaza opens at 7 a.m.; by 7:15 a dozen men in business suits are blasting away at the games while coffee in plastic cups grows cold. L'Enfant Plaza is within walking distance of at least five major Government agencies. "Office workers seem to need to blow it out" in their fantasies more than other people, says Tom McAuliffe, 33, vice president for operations of the 51-store chain that owns the arcade.</p>`
